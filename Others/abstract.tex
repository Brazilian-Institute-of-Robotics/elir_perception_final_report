The maintenance of high voltage lines is a high-cost and dangerous activity for the employee's physical integrity. To replace human performance in risky activities, many robotic solutions are being implemented because of the reliability involved. The  Electrical Inspection Robot (ELIR) is a high voltage line inspection robot using thermal imaging, its sensing system has several sensors and is capable of displaying all occurrences detected during the mission and informing the date, time and location of each one. This final course project describes the methodology, concepts and the results obtained during the perception system development. This report counts with undergraduate and doctorate students with the goal to promote development and research on robotics area.
